### Analyzing the Lego Dataset from Kaggle.

In this repo I'm just playing around with the Lego dataset, learning SQL along the way.

##### Kaggle's Lego Database Schema.


My analysis of the database can be found here: `exploring_lego_sets.ipynb`


In `creating_lego_db_functional_approach.py ` I used a functional approach to create the database, inspired by the book [Bioinformatics Programming Using Python](https://www.amazon.com/Bioinformatics-Programming-Using-Python-Biological/dp/059615450X). Since I had already created the db for my analysis, this file was just SQL practice.
